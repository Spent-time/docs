## Three ways to get there


At the moment there are three ways to ceate your account with Spent time:

 * [Use your Github account](#github)
 * [Use your Facebook account](#facebook)
 * [Create a Spent time account](#account)
 
We will introduce more social sign-in options in the (near) future.<br>
The ones that are on the short term planning: 

 * Bitbuckit
 * Trello  
 * Podio

For now you can use Github and Facebook or create a Spent time account and we will keep you updated on any new additions.
