## What is Spent time?

<br>
Spent time is all about managing your time based work.<br>
If you work the type of job where you need to register how long you have been working on different issues or customers, Spent time is for you.

Trough the tracker integration you are enabled to book your spent time on tasks administered in for instance Github, Bitbucket, Podio or Trello items.

You can track your time centrally in Spent time and based on your settings control what gets synchronized with the remote service. 

The use of multiple trackers can be confusing from a planning point of view, with the integration you can plan your work centrally for multiple trackers which will avoid overlap in your planned time.

## Can i use it for my invoices?

<br>
Altough we do provide reporting layout capabilities where you can easily create a report that could look like and be used as an invoice, this is not one of our main service goals. Spent time is not an invoicing system. 

We do plan on integration with services like Zoho, Freshbooks or Quickbooks where you can synchronize your booked time for use in your accounting processes. 


## Can i use it as my accounting system?

<br>
Although you can add tags to your trackable items where you can keep track of all sorts of figures, we do not aim at providing you with an accounting (bookkeeping) service.

We only account for your registered time but will provide integration with services like Zoho, Freshbooks or Quickbooks in the near future.
